# CSC207Project
For the project, we would like to design a **restaurant searching software**.

Our software specifications are as follows:

- New users can register their accounts by inputting a username, a password, a confirmation password and a city name.=
- Existing users can log in with their username and password, and log out if they want.
- Existing users can modify the city they are in.
- List out restaurants in the city where the user is, and more specifically:
  - Display reviews including the ratings, and other relevant information (such as restaurant category and consumption per person)
  - Rank the restaurants by the user’s preference， like which kind of restaurant.
  - Users can sort and filter restaurants by the category of restaurant, the consumption per person, and other options.
  - Users can add and remove certain restaurants from their Favourites Lists.
  - Users can write reviews and add ratings to restaurants.
  - Users can review their history of reviews and ratings (Not implemented yet).

The software currently is functioning. One may run the main class to launch the software.
The software currently is submitted for evaluation.
