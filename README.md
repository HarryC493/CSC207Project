# CSC207Project
For the project, we would like to design a **restaurant searching and recommendation software**.

Our software specifications are as follows:

- New users can register their accounts by inputting a username, and a password, and repeating the password again to make sure the password is consistent.
- Existing users can log in with their username and password, and log out if they want.
- Existing users can reset their passwords after they log in or the code sent via a confirmation email if they forgot their original password.
- Existing users can select the city they are in.
- List out restaurants in the city where the user is, and more specifically:
  - Display reviews including the ratings, and other relevant information (such as restaurant category and consumption per person)
  - Rank the restaurants by the user’s preference， like which kind of restaurant.
  - Users can sort and filter restaurants by the category of restaurant, the consumption per person, and other options.
  - Users can add and remove certain restaurants from their Favourites Lists.
  - Users can write reviews and add ratings to restaurants.
  - Users can review their history of reviews and ratings.

JDBC is the API we are going to use for database.
