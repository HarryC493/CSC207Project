For Week3 Design Question

- The **problem domain** that we would like to focus on is data analysis of the stock market data.

- We would like to build an application that can take raw stock data from our API and return calculated statistics based on mathematical models and create data visualizations. We are also thinking of implementing a watchlist of stocks that the user can manage the stocks he/she is interested in (adding new stocks or delete uninterested one).

- https://www.alphavantage.co/documentation/ this is the **link to the documentation for an API** our team can use related to the domain.

- Below is **screenshot of using a tool to try out the API**
